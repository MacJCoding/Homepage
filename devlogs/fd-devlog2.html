			<h1 style="text-align: center">Fusara Duelists Devlog #2 - Design & Inspiration</h1>
			<p> Back in my first devlog I mentioned a couple of games that I took inspiration from.
			Some of these games includes Hearthstone and Slay the Spire.
			However, there were other games that did have inspirations in small parts of my game. 
			<!--Please note that I will be referring to the other versions of Fusara Duelists in this devlog.-->
			</p>
			<p> In Obstruction, the first version of Fusara Duelists, the battle phase shows, a warrior battling a square sprite.
				This is similar to most RPG games like Final Fanatasy or Angry Birds Epic, which was a game I was playing for a bit at the time.
				These games would have the player or the player's team on one side and then the enemy or group of enemies on the other.
				I was considering of having a random chance of encountering a hoard of enemies, similar to Pokemon's Hoard Battles.
				However, one thing that I still kept in mind is that I wanted to make something that I was capable of. 
				It has been five or six years since I made Obstruction and I would've been able to make that consideration now,
				but back then, I was still a beginner and was still playing around with the many features that Unity has.

			<p>As I continued working on Fusara Duelists during the Obstruction phase and the thrid and fourth version, I started to give a theme to the characters.
			A point of reference I was referring to was Fire Emblem Heroes with their attacks and design.
			In Fusara Duelists, I made a mechanic that would be a main part of the game.
			In Hearthstone, when your hero has an attack value, you can choose to attack an enemy during your turn.
			However, in Fusara Duelists this is slightly different.
			So you can play cards that would give you a number of attack.
			But it is at the end of your turn is when your player actually attacks the enemy.
			The reason why I went for this design is because there aren't multiple enemies to attack, and if you gain attack, the player might as well attack the enemy anyways. 
			This mechanic also helps the player just in case they forget to attack for lethal - (Lethal means to  get your opponents health to 0)

			</div>
			<p>In the next devlog, I will talk more about the mechanics of Fusara Duelists, notably card mechanics. 
			Similar to the design, the cards for Fusara Duelists share similarities with Hearthstone and a bit of Slay the Spire.
			Since these two games are like the bases for Fusara Duelists, some of their mechanics are part of the game.
			So until I will see you in the next devlog.
