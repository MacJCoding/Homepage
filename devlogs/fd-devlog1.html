			<p> Welcome to my first devlog of my website. 
			I'm glad that you have taken interest in my work.
			Fusara Duelists was a game that I want to make since high school.
			But ever since then there has been multiple versions, including the first one in which I will be talking about.
			</p>
			<p>Before Fusara Duelists even got its name, it was called Obstruction.
			It was called Obstruction as it was somewhat related to Obsestileo, who is a character that you can play as in the game.
			Obstruction was an alright name, but as I start using it in my Youtube devlogs, Obstruction didn't seem like it was the right fit.
			</p>
			<p>So when I reworked Fusara Duelists into a different version, I changed the name to reflect the universe that it takes place in.
			Some of you may be wondering, "What  is a Fusara?" Well in terms of the lore of Obsetileo (yes, there is lore).
			Fusara is what I call, an entity that allows the characters of Fusara Duelists to switch between each other.
			If you are still confused, think about Mythra and Pyrra from Xenoblade Chronicles and how they can switch between each other.
			I do have an animated short that shows the Fusara's ability in action, switching the characters. 
			However, this ability is NOT the main mechanic for this game, sadly.

			<p>My first version of Fusara Duelists (which will be referred to as Obstruction), was created after I first learend Unity for 1 year. 
			It was essistially my first time trying how I would do when making a card video game.
			With my knowledge of playing a couple card games, there is more than just coding the game.
			What I mean is that, just because the game has cards that you can play, it doesn't mean the game is nice game to play.
			One of the things that I looked out for was gameplay.
			Luckily, I had two games that I can get inspiration from.
			</p>
			<h2>Inspirations</h2>
			<p>When I first started coding in high school, I loved playing this card game called Hearthstone.
			The reason why I liked it was because of the amount of strategies and problem-solving that you need to use to play.
			So when making this game, I wanted to make it with strategy and makes you think in order for you to win.
			I wanted to make this game simple for me to code, so instead of recreating Hearthstone, I would recreate Hearthstone but without minions, or a board to play.
			After creating the first prototype and playtesting with my classmates, I realized that Obstruction is similar to another game - Slay the Spire.
			I personally never played Slay the Spire, but looking at some gameplay there were some similarities.
			Like Hearthstone, cards in your hand are played if you have enough mana for it, or in Slay the Sprire if you have enough energy. 
			Thats really the only mechanic similarities they share, but that is only comparing to standard Hearthstone.
			</p>
			<p>There is another gamemode in Hearthstone called Solo Adventures, and some of these are Dungeon Runs.
			Dungeon Runs are similar to Slay the Spire, where you are given a set deck, and must defeated, usually, 8 enemies. 
			As you defeat each enemy, you choose from three choices, each choice with 3 cards, to add to your deck.
			This is similar to Slay the Spire, where after you defeat an enemy you add new cards, items, and do actions that can change your deck and playstyle.

			<p>This devlog is mostly an introduction on the idea of Obstruction and Fusara Duelists.
			I will talk a little bit more on the design of Obstruction in the next devlog. 
			This marks the first "written" devlog of Fusara Duelists.
